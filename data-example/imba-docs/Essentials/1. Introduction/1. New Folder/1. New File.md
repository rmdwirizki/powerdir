Imba is a new programming language for the web that compiles
to performant JavaScript. It is heavily inspired by ruby and python,
but developed explicitly for web programming (both server and client).
Imba treats DOM elements as a first-class citizens. These elements are compiled to an [inline dom](/guides/advanced/performance), which is an [order of magnitude faster](https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html) than todays virtual dom implementations. We truly believe that it opens up for a new way of developing web applications.

```imba
var number = 42
var opposite = true
var string = "the answer is {number}"
var regex = /answer is (\d+)/

> Even though Imba has been used privately, in production, for more than a year (powering scrimba.com), the community is  in the early stages, and documentation is still sparse. We're incredibly grateful for any feedback, suggestions, and help with the documentation!
